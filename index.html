<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>
    Hi! This personal blog is mainly intended for me. But you may find some information
    here useful, so feel free to check some <a href="/posts.html">posts</a> where I
    mostly write about some technical or IT related topics, or you can also check my cheat
    <a href="/cheats.html">sheets</a> specially if you are linux user which uses vim, git,
    bash on a daily basis. Feel free to land on my <a href="/pages/projects.html">projects</a>
    page, where you can find some software as well as hardware projects which I've been
    working on.
</p>

<p>
    As you can already see, I like technology and software programming. And that's also
    what I do for living as well in my spare time.
</p>

<p>
    But don't be fooled. I also like to draw. You can check some of my art
    <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bendo.art">here</a>. Sometimes you can find me
    flying fpv drones or I just lock myself in my laboratory and I build robots.
    On weekends you can find me wandering in the mountains.
</p>

<p>
    By the way... you can call me bendo. Enjoy...
